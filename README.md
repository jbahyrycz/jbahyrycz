### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Julia and I am the second year student of **Computer Science in Engineering** at **AGH University of Science and Technology**.
Apart from my university course I'm learning **graphics programming** on my own. I'm currently working on 3D Checkers game using **C++** and **OpenGL API**. The source code will be publicly available on my github when I finish.

<!--**jbahyrycz/jbahyrycz** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
